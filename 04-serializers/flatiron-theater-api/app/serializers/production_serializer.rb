  # 1. Add attributes for "title", "genre", "description", "image", 
  # "director", "budget", "ongoing"

  # 2. Add Active Record Macros to Return Associated Tickets / Users

  # 3. Add a method (budget) that returns Production's budget as a floating point number
  # with only two digits following the decimal point (i.e., 10000.00)

  # NOTE => Try making use of string interpolation and "'%.2f' %"

  # 4. Add a method (ongoing) that returns "Actively Showing" if a Production's 
  # "ongoing" value is 'true' and "Not Showing" if a Production's "ongoing" value
  # is 'false'

  # NOTE => To simplify your code, try implementing a ternary operator.
